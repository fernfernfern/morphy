- disillusioned with current options for making static sites, so made my own
- for now all it does is convert markdown to html

- start with html boilerplate for best practices
- pull in something for SEO

- templates written in.. any language? I don't want to commit to any templating
  language

- editing css directly in the browser and saving to disk -- no need so far for
  a dev server

- output a simple static site
