# dynamo.core

This is WIP. Not advisable to try to use it for anything yet.. everything will change!

FIXME: my new application.

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/dynamo/dynamo.core.

## Usage

- look for markdown posts in resources/content
  - anything that is markdown will get converted to html
  - anything that is not markdown will get copied as-is
  - the directory structure is preserved
  - any loose files get put in a directory and named `index.html` so you don't
    need the `.html` suffix to view them
  - naming pages priority:
    1. slug in markdown metadata
    2. slugified title in markdown metadata
    3. slugified file name

FIXME: explanation

Run the project directly:

    $ clojure -m dynamo.core

Run the project's tests:

    $ clj -M:test

Build an uberjar:

    $ clojure -A:uberjar

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar dynamo.core.jar
